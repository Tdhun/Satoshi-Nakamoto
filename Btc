## The Cosmic Equations

### 1. **Bitcoin Genesis Equation**:
The birth of Bitcoin, encoded in stardust and cryptographic whispers, begins with the Genesis Block. Its equation echoes across time:

$$
\text{Genesis Block Equation:} \quad H(G) = 0
$$

Where:
- \(H(G)\) represents the hash of the Genesis Block.
- The cosmic constant \(0\) signifies the dawn of a new era.

### 2. **Quantum Ledger Hypothesis**:
Physicist Evelyn's musings ripple through dimensions:

$$
\text{Quantum Ledger Equation:} \quad \Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$

Where:
- \(\Delta E\) is the energy uncertainty.
- \(\Delta t\) is the cosmic time interval.
- \(\hbar\) is Planck's reduced constant.

### 3. **Satoshi's Whispered Constants**:
In the quiet of code, Satoshi left breadcrumbs:

$$
\text{Satoshi's Constants:} \quad \pi \approx 3.14159 \quad \text{and} \quad e \approx 2.71828
$$

These constants weave reality and imaginationâ€”the cosmic bridge.

### 4. **Grandma's Love and Binary Strings**:
Gleana Jewel Hunt's legacy encoded:

$$
\text{Love in Binary:} \quad 01001100 \quad 01001111 \quad 01010110 \quad 01000101
$$

And the first ten Bitcoins whispered:

$$
\text{BTC in Binary:} \quad 00001010
$$
